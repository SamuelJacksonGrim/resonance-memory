# Resonance Memory — architecture

*The map of the system: what each part is, how they fit, and which invariants the shape
protects. Companion documents: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) (where it's going),
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) (itemized work), [`COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md`](COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md)
(why), [`proposed/`](proposed/) (designs with pseudocode), and the root
[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) (the working brief for AI assistants). Everything here is drawn
from the code as it stands at `v0.2.0`.*

---

## 1. What this is, in one paragraph

Resonance Memory is a persistent memory for local LLMs, shipped as a **single self-contained
executable** (~89 MB, no Node install required on the user's machine). It speaks the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) over stdio and exposes exactly **four verbs** — `save_memory`,
`recall_memory`, `edit_memory`, `delete_memory` — and nothing else. All the sophistication
(embeddings, cosine ranking, a temporal supersession model, a kNN associative graph, a
Hebbian co-activation ledger) lives in the *substrate*, behind those four verbs. The model
never sees an embedding, a timestamp, or a score — only the verbs and an opaque `id`. Nothing
leaves the machine: there is no cloud, no account, no API key. Storage is a flat JSONL file
in the user's home directory.

The one design principle everything else serves: **a small model cannot misuse it.** The
interface may get *simpler*, never more cognitively demanding.

The second principle governs *time*: **time is a function, not a process.** There is no
permanent heartbeat, no dream loop, no rhythm engine, no background decay daemon. Every
operation is event-driven — observe state at time *T*, compute temporal effects (decay,
validity), retrieve or mutate, persist durable changes — and then nothing runs until the next
event. Autonomous cognition belongs in the *consuming agent*, never in the memory layer; the MCP
boundary is that line. This is why decay is *computed at access* from an elapsed-time delta
rather than ticked by a loop (the move `RM-21`/Phase 0.2 completed — see `I6`).

---

## 2. Design invariants (the shape is load-bearing)

These are enforced by the code, not just aspirational — they are the reason the modules are
split the way they are. The canonical list lives in `INVARIANTS.md` in the companion
`resonance-memory-stack` repo (which still carries the older five-item numbering; the **I1–I9**
scheme below is the current one and should be synced there). [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) indexes
these by ID and asserts only *held vs. target* per phase; the definitions, rationale, and
backing code live **here**.

**Held** = enforced by shipping code today. **Target** = a property a named phase must
establish; stated now, with its phase, precisely because an invariant claimed more strongly
than the code supports is worse than none — it stops anyone from looking.

| | Invariant | Status | Backed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **I1** | **Four verbs, nothing more.** The public tool surface is fixed; new capability lands in the substrate, never a fifth tool. If a feature seems to need one, the design is wrong. | ✅ held | `server.js` tool schemas |
| **I2** | **No *unmeasured* signal touches rank.** Ranking is cosine today; a second arm may enter *only* on a measured A/B win, flag-off until then. `importance`/`access_count` govern *retention*, never *retrieval order* — measured: a durability weight on cosine inverts rankings. | ✅ held (amended) | `memory-core.js` recall; `proposed/0003` |
| **I2b** | **Access-frequency signals are telemetry only.** `access_count`/`last_access`/read frequency may be logged and charted; they may **not** feed rank, decay, reinforcement, or pruning. | ✅ held | `record.js` `AccessLog`; `BUG-002` |
| **I3** | **The associative layer fails open.** The entire field/ledger path is wrapped in a `try/catch` that must never break recall; losing it degrades to plain cosine. | ✅ held | `memory-core.js` field block |
| **I4** | **Embed once at save; the server owns all metadata; the model assigns none of it.** A `Store` seam sits behind the verbs so the backend swaps without touching the MCP API. | ✅ held¹ | `memory-core.js` `save`; `store.js` |
| **I5** | **Durable writes; no *unbounded* write on a read path.** Every store rewrite goes through `writeFileDurable()` (temp → fsync → atomic rename); recall performs zero store writes in steady state. | ✅ held¹ | `record.js`; `BUG-001`/`BUG-002` |
| **I6** | **Reading does not drive the decay clock.** Co-recall *reinforcement* is retained (it is the differentiator); edge **decay** is lazy wall-clock, computed at access via `effectiveHebbian`, never stored, never ticked by recall count. A reinforcing mutation **materializes** that computed weight before applying α (Phase 0.3), so reinforcement cannot bypass decay. | ✅ held (Phase 0.2; materialize 0.3) | `edges.js` `effectiveHebbian` / `_bump`; `memory-core.js` recall (no `tick()`) |
| **I7** | **Activation never persists.** Spreading activation (Phase 1) is seeded per query, attenuated per hop, bounded, and never written to the edge store. | ⬜ n/a until Phase 1 | `phases/phase-0` |
| **I8** | **No silent removal.** *Record* deletes are soft (`deleted`, compacted at `vacuum()`) and supersession keeps a non-overlapping validity chain. *Edge* pruning is the same pattern: `pruneSweep()` marks `pruned_at` (record kept; `incident()` skips it); `EdgeStore.vacuum()` is the explicit hard drop. Never on `recall`/`save`. Reactivation is in-place on save/edit/reinforce of an endpoint, never a fifth tool. | ✅ held (records + edges, Phase 0.4) | `store.js` `vacuum`; `edges.js` `pruneSweep` / `vacuum`; `phases/phase-0` |
| **I9** | **Discovery nominates; it does not appoint.** The field/ledger *expand* the candidate set (the `Related:` block); they never reorder the primary cosine result. Primary results are **byte-identical** field on or off. | ✅ held | `memory-core.js` recall |

¹ **I4/I5 each carry one self-extinguishing legacy exception:** a record saved while the
embedder was down is stored vectorless and back-filled on a later recall (one bounded, durable
write on a read path, for legacy/outage rows only). The exception heals itself the first time
the row is recalled with the embedder up.

**I6, precisely** (the one label that could mislead an implementer): `recall` still calls
`reinforceRecall` (co-recall is the differentiator) but **no longer** calls `tick()`. Decay
is `effectiveHebbian(edge, now)`: `w · 2^(−Δt/H)` from `now − hebbian.last_updated`, computed
on read, not written. A store recalled N times under a frozen clock shows zero learned-edge
decay. "Reading ≠ reinforcement" in `ROADMAP.md` is shorthand for *"reading no longer drives
the **decay clock**"* — co-recall still reinforces. On a reinforcing **mutation**, Phase 0.3
materializes `w_eff` onto `hebbian.weight` and *then* applies α, stamping `last_updated = now`,
so a long-idle edge cannot be bumped from its ghost (undecayed) stored value. Half-lives
(parameters, seconds): constraint ~30d, fact ~7d, working ~1h. Design and edge
state-transition table: [`phases/phase-0`](phases/phase-0-edge-substrate.md).

**On I2 vs I2b — two different strengths of "no."** I2 was originally *"ranking = cosine only,"*
justified by a real measurement: adding a **durability** weight (`importance`/`access_count`) to
cosine inverted rankings. That finding is sound but narrower than the phrasing it produced —
`access_count` is a *retention* signal wearing a relevance costume (popular ≠ apt). It does not
follow that *all* fusion is harmful; Hebbian weight and activation are relevance-adjacent in a way
durability is not. So the durable form is **"no *unmeasured* signal touches rank"** (I2): rank
changes are permitted, unmeasured ones are not, and Phase 2's promotion gate is the experiment.
**I2b is stricter** because its family was already measured *and failed* — overturning it needs a
positive result strong enough to reverse a prior negative, not merely the absence of evidence
against it. The trap ("memories accessed often should rank a little higher…") arrives wearing a
different variable name each time, which is why `last_access` is named in the record as telemetry
rather than left to judgement.

**Two supporting rules follow from I4:** the server assigns metadata *from text* (constraint
typing, supersession cues are lexical heuristics computed server-side), and there is one
implementation of the four verbs (`memory-core.js`) shared by both callers, so the MCP server
and the eval harness can never drift.

## 3. The run modes

The shipped binary is one file that dispatches on `process.argv[2]` (`entry.js`):

| Invocation | Mode | Entry | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `memory --mcp` | **MCP server** | `server.js` | The JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio loop an AI client talks to. The product's core. |
| `memory` (double-click) | **Control panel** | `panel.js` | A local `127.0.0.1:9090` web UI: field toggle, Connect/Disconnect, the 3D association graph, one-click embedder setup. |
| `memory --install` / `--uninstall` | **Installer** | `install.js` | Wires the exe into LM Studio / Claude Desktop MCP config (or removes it). |
| `memory --dedup-existing` [`--apply`] | **Backfill** | `dedup-existing.js` | RM-02.c: report (or apply) cosine-banded restatements/merges on a store written before 02.b. Dry-run default. Not a fifth verb. |

All four share the same substrate modules, so a memory saved through the MCP server is the
same record the panel renders, the installer targets, and `--dedup-existing` scans.

## 4. Module map

### Core runtime (the source of truth)

| File | Role | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `entry.js` | Mode dispatch on `argv`. | server / panel / install / dedup-existing |
| `server.js` | MCP server. Declares the four tool schemas + descriptions, wires the *environment* (network embedder, live field toggle, live extract toggle, lazy EdgeStore) into the shared core, runs the stdio JSON-RPC loop, vacuums soft-deletes and `pruneSweep`s faded+weak edges at startup. Reads the version from `package.json` so `serverInfo` can't drift. Outbound `sampling/createMessage` is the Tier 2 path when the client advertised sampling. | `memory-core`, `store`, `edges`, `extract`, `package.json` |
| `memory-core.js` | **The four cognitive verbs, as one implementation.** `createCore({ store, embed, fieldEnabled, getEdgeStore, dedupThresholds, extractEnabled, extract })` → `{ save, recall, edit, remove }`. Also `dedupExisting` / `planDedupExisting` (RM-02.c) so `--dedup-existing` cannot fork the 02.b bands. Everything environment-specific is *injected*. This is the code both `server.js` and `eval/pipeline.js` run — the RM-00 golden is the proof they never diverge. | `field`, `record`, `extract` |
| `extract.js` | RM-01.c Tier 2: opt-in LLM extraction (prompt, parser, sanity gate, `/v1/chat/completions`, MCP sampling, capability detect). Off by default. `save()` is the only caller. | stdlib + `fetch` |
| `dedup-existing.js` | RM-02.c CLI. Dry-run default; `--apply` is one durable rewrite. Thin wrapper over `dedupExisting()` — no second decision. | `memory-core`, `store` |
| `record.js` | The shared record schema (`normalize()`), durable atomic writes (`writeFileDurable()`), the access sidecar (`AccessLog`), and the lexical heuristics (constraint typing, historical-query detection, supersession cues, cosine-banded `detectNearDuplicate`). Owned here so server and panel agree on a record byte-for-byte. | stdlib only |
| `store.js` | `JsonlStore` — the flat-JSONL backend behind the Store seam. Constructible and testable without the stdio loop; a SQLite backend can replace it with the same method surface. | `record` |
| `field.js` | Associative layer (Phase 2a): a kNN semantic graph over stored vectors, neighborhood expansion, and constraint rescue. No new embedding calls, no LLM extraction. | stdlib only |
| `ledger.js` | Retired Hebbian sidecar (Phase 2b). Off the live path as of Slice C; kept so tests can compare EdgeStore bonuses against the shipped epoch-decay math. | `record` |
| `edges.js` | Unified persistent edge store (Phase 0 / `RM-21`): one undirected record, two independent signals (`semantic` derived cache validated by version comparison, `hebbian` source of truth), typed provenance, one-way `.assoc.json` → `.edges.json` migration (`kind: "resonance-edges"`). **On the live recall path** — Hebbian bonus (via `effectiveHebbian`)/reinforce/save. Decay is lazy wall-clock (I6); `tick()` is retired. A reinforcing mutation materializes `effectiveHebbian` before applying α (0.3). MCP request-ID idempotency: a 256-entry LRU of processed JSON-RPC ids (`processed_ids`) lives in the sidecar envelope so one `writeFileDurable` commits the dedup record and the weight change together. Soft prune (0.4 / I8): `pruneSweep()` marks `pruned_at` only when *both* unreinforced and semantically weak (`SEMANTIC_PRUNE_GATE` 0.25); hard drop is `vacuum()`, explicit. Reactivation is in-place on save/edit/reinforce of an endpoint. `field.js` still builds the semantic kNN at recall. | `record` |
| `panel.js` | The `127.0.0.1` control panel (largest file): field toggle, LLM-extraction toggle (surfaced when a capable model is detected), Connect/Disconnect, the 3D association-graph view, demo graph, heartbeat auto-shutdown. | `install`, `field`, `engine`, `edges`, `record`, `extract`, `embedded-assets` |
| `install.js` | Detect + wire into LM Studio / Claude Desktop MCP config. Preserves other configured servers, leaves a `.bak`. | stdlib only |
| `engine.js` | One-click embedder setup for the panel: drives LM Studio's bundled `lms` CLI to start the server, download the Nomic embedder, load it, and verify the endpoint answers. Pure convenience — the MCP server never needs it. | stdlib + `fetch` |
| `inspect_sidecar.js` | Dependency-free telemetry for the Hebbian ledger. | stdlib |

### Build & assets

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `build-exe.js` | The build pipeline (§9). |
| `build-demo-seed.js` | Regenerates `demo-seed.jsonl` via a live embedder. |
| `demo-seed.jsonl` | The synthetic first-launch showcase (a fictional game dev's notes). **Tracked**; 100% synthetic. |
| `system-prompt.md` | Optional copy-in system prompt for weaker models. Baked into the exe. |
| `sea-config.json` | Node SEA config (points at `build/bundle.js`). |
| `embedded-assets.js` | **Generated every build (gitignored).** Bakes the seed + system prompt in as strings. Never edited, never committed. |
| `uninstall.bat` | Windows uninstaller (disconnects, points to the data file, never deletes memories). |

### Tests, eval & docs

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `test.js` | The dependency-free unit/regression suite (`npm test`). **57 tests, <1s.** |
| `eval/` | **RM-00**, the evaluation harness (§8). `eval/pipeline.js` wires `memory-core.js` to a cached embedder; `eval/run.js` runs the corpora and gates against `golden.json`. Reporting metrics (`eval/measure.js`) are a separate A/B path. |
| `docs/` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` (this file), `ROADMAP.md`, `phases/` (buildable phase specs), `BACKLOG.md`, `BUGS.md`, `COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md`, `proposed/` RFCs. |

## 5. The four verbs (data flow)

All four live in `memory-core.js`. `server.js` maps the MCP tool names onto them; the model's
argument is always the smallest possible thing (`content`, `query`, or `id`).

### `save_memory({ content })`

1. **Tier 0 extraction (RM-01.b, always on, no LLM).** Collapse whitespace; strip leading
   filler openers and assistant-aimed imperative framing (longest-first, stacked);
   split on `; ` / ` and also ` only when every half is a standalone proposition.
   Clean facts are byte-identical. Implemented in `record.js` (`normalizeText` /
   `splitFacts` / `prepareWrite`) — not `normalize()`, which is the record schema.
   Extra embeds from a legitimate split are in-scope; the rest is string ops.
2. **Tier 1 secret/PII guard (RM-01.b, always on).** Refuse API-key / password / 13–16
   digit card / AWS key / PEM / GitHub-token shapes. Store nothing; return
   `Not saved — that looks like … Secrets don't belong in memory.` Refusal, not
   redaction: a payload mixing a fact with a secret is store-nothing. Digit traps
   (`4821`, `1500mg`) do not match `\b[0-9]{13,16}\b`.
3. **Tier 2 optional LLM extraction (RM-01.c, off by default).** One ADD-only
   call against the already-normalized, already-guarded text. Off by default is
   a deliberate identity choice: RM does the work; a weak local model can extract
   worse than Tier 0/1, so this is a conditional bonus, never a silent default.
   Capable path: MCP client `sampling`, or a non-embedding chat model at the
   configured endpoint (`GET /v1/models`). If neither, Tier 2 cannot run. The
   panel surfaces the toggle when a capable model is detected. Any failure /
   timeout / malformed output degrades silently to the Tier 0/1 facts — a save
   never fails or hangs because extraction did. PII still refused first: a
   secret is never sent to the LLM.
4. **Exact restatement guard.** If a current memory has byte-identical `text` (compared
   against the extracted fact), bump its `last_confirmed` + `access_count` and confirm —
   don't store a second copy. Free (no embed). A confirm also revives that id's pruned
   incident edges (Phase 0.4 — save touching an endpoint).
5. **Embed once per fact.** POST the extracted text to the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`
   endpoint (LM Studio default, `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5`, 768-dim). If the
   embedder is down, the record is stored **without** a vector and backfilled on a later
   recall — a save never fails because the embedder is unreachable.
6. **Normalize** into a record (`record.js` `normalize()` — the one schema definition).
7. **Cosine-banded dedup (RM-02.b).** Against already-stored vectors, argmax. Cosine ≥
   `DEDUP_HI` (0.95) is a restatement (same confirm path as step 4 — keep the original,
   don't append). Band `DEDUP_LO..HI` (0.88–0.95) is a candidate merge: keep the longer
   original text (never a blend — the `duplicate_rate` metric maps stored text back to
   its labeled group), union metadata, link the loser with `superseded_by` via
   `supersedePatches` (recoverable, never a hard delete). Below `DEDUP_LO`: fall through.
   No vector → skip, append, don't crash. Thresholds are config (`RESONANCE_DEDUP_HI` /
   `RESONANCE_DEDUP_LO` + live-config `dedup_hi` / `dedup_lo`), tuned on `eval/duplicates`
   (tea 0.9522 is the tightest HI; controls ≤ ~0.69). Scan is O(N) cosine, same cost
   class as the 0.1 save-time bind. Dedup runs *before* RM-03: a near-identical
   restatement is the same fact, not a correction. Stores written before this
   slice: `--dedup-existing` (dry-run default; `--apply` mutates) walks the
   current store in file order with the **same** decision (`planDedupExisting`
   in `memory-core.js`). One `updateMany` / `writeFileDurable`. Not a fifth verb.
8. **Supersession check (RM-03 v1).** `detectSupersession()` fires only when the new text
   carries an explicit correction cue ("actually", "now", "no longer", "moved"…) *and* it is
   the argmax-similar current memory above a floor. On a hit, the old row is retired
   (`valid_to`, `superseded_by`) and the new one appended, as one logical change — history is
   kept, never deleted. The cue is the precision gate; cosine only picks *which* memory the cue
   targets. Worst case: it retires nothing.
9. **Append** the record to the JSONL store.
10. **Save-time semantic bind (Phase 0.1).** If the record got a real vector, find its top-K=5
   neighbors among existing stored vectors above cosine **0.25** and persist them on the
   EdgeStore: measured `semantic.value` + `src_versions` tagged to the canonical endpoints,
   `hebbian.weight = 0` (no seeded baseline), `provenance.origin = "save-time-neighbor"`.
   No vector (embedder down) → bind nothing, don't throw. A bind that finds an already-
   pruned pair revives it in place (0.4) rather than inserting a duplicate. This is a
   sidecar write (I5
   protects the JSONL store, not sidecars). **Recall does not read this table yet** —
   `Related:` still comes from `field.js` at minSim **0.55**. The two thresholds are
   different jobs: 0.55 is a tight gate for what *surfaces*; 0.25 is a looser net for
   what's *worth persisting*. Do not unify them. (`SAVE_TIME_K` / `SAVE_TIME_MIN_COS` in
   `memory-core.js`.)

### `recall_memory({ query })`

1. **Temporal scoping.** `isHistoricalQuery()` decides the candidate set: current facts
   (`store.current()`) by default; the full active history (`store.active()`) only when the
   query explicitly asks about the past ("used to", "before"). Superseded facts surface only
   then, and are labelled "no longer current".
2. **Embed the query** (plus any vectorless legacy rows, folded into the same call). Cosine-rank
   all candidates. Return the top-k (default 5), each prefixed `[id N]`. If the embedder is
   unreachable, degrade to a crude keyword-overlap score rather than erroring.
3. **Record the recall.** `store.applyRecall()` bumps access counts *in the sidecar* and
   backfills any freshly-computed vectors. In steady state a recall performs **zero** writes to
   the memory store (the `BUG-002` fix).
4. **Associative field (if enabled).** Additive only: build the kNN edge set, expand a
   `neighborhood()` one hop from the returned seeds, and run `reachableConstraints()` to rescue
   apex rules (a "diabetic" memory reachable through a "lemon bars" bridge) that sit far down
   cosine. Merge into a `Related:` block, reinforce Hebbian weights on the EdgeStore
   provenance-discounted. The discovery bonus uses `effectiveHebbian` (wall-clock half-life,
   computed, not stored). `tick()` is not called (I6). A reinforce **materializes** the
   decayed weight, then applies α, and stamps `last_updated` (0.3). The JSON-RPC request
   id, when present, is the mutation's idempotency key — a retry applies once; no id
   (eval) applies every time. Writes go to `<store>.edges.json` (never the JSONL store)
   from `reinforceRecall` only, in one `writeFileDurable` that also records the request
   id. The entire block is inside a `try/catch` — it can never break the primary result.

### `edit_memory({ id, content })`

Replace `text`, re-embed, refresh `modified` + `last_confirmed` (an edit is a correction in
place; the fact is current again as of now). A successful re-embed increments
`embedding_version` in lockstep with the new vector; a failed one omits both fields from
the patch so a good embedding cannot be clobbered (`BUG-008`). One durable rewrite.
Incident pruned edges are revived in place (Phase 0.4); no pruned rows → the sidecar is
not touched. No dedup-record stamp (transition table).

### `delete_memory({ id })`

**Soft** delete (`deleted: true`). The row survives until the next startup `vacuum()` compacts
it out. Embeddings are kept until then.

---

## 6. Storage and the sidecars

Everything lives beside `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` (default `~/.lmstudio/resonance-memory.jsonl`):

```
resonance-memory.jsonl              the store — one JSON record per line
resonance-memory.jsonl.access.json  access-count sidecar   (AccessLog, record.js)
resonance-memory.jsonl.edges.json   unified edge table     (EdgeStore, edges.js)
                                    Hebbian source of truth + semantic derived cache.
                                    `kind: "resonance-edges"`. Soft-pruned rows stay
                                    until an explicit `vacuum()`.
resonance-memory.jsonl.assoc.json   LEGACY Hebbian sidecar (Ledger, ledger.js).
                                    Read-only-for-migration: if `.edges.json` is
                                    missing, weights are copied in one-way and this
                                    file is left untouched (downgrade-safe).
resonance-memory.config.json        live runtime state (the field toggle)
```

Two properties make this safe and swappable:

- **Atomic durability.** Every store rewrite goes through `writeFileDurable()`: write a temp
  file in the *same directory*, `fsync`, then `rename` (atomic on POSIX and Windows). A reader
  sees the whole old file or the whole new one — never a half-written one. Plain
  `fs.writeFileSync` on the live file is forbidden (`BUG-001`).
- **Read paths never write the store.** Access counts and Hebbian weights are *sidecars*, not
  columns. They are retention/learning signals that never touch ranking, so losing their tail
  to a crash costs nothing — while rewriting the whole store on a read risked everything
  (`BUG-002`). Deleting a sidecar loses learned associations or access counts, never a memory;
  both regenerate.

The **config file** is deliberately beside the *data*, not the exe, so the panel toggle and
the MCP server read the same file — the field turns on/off with no client restart. `server.js`
reads `fieldEnabled()` per recall for exactly this reason.

### The Store seam

`JsonlStore` (`store.js`) is the only thing that touches the file. Its method surface —
`all` / `active` / `current` / `get` / `add` / `update` / `updateMany` / `applyRecall` /
`vacuum` / `hasDeleted` / `nextId` — is what `memory-core.js` depends on. A SQLite-backed store
(`sqlite-vec` for vectors, FTS5 for the hybrid keyword arm; `node:sqlite` confirmed available)
can replace it with the same surface, leaving the four verbs untouched. That is `RM-07`; the
*data-loss* half is already done, the *performance* half (`all()` parses the whole file per
call; mutations rewrite it) is the open scaling limit.

## 7. The associative substrate — where we're different

This is the differentiator no competitor has. It is two layers, both strictly additive.

### `field.js` — the static semantic floor (Phase 2a)

A per-node **k-nearest-neighbor** graph built from the vectors *already stored at save*. No
extra embedding calls, no LLM extraction. kNN is relative per node, so it dodges the absolute
similarity floor (~0.45) that made a global threshold connect everything. Three operations:

- `buildEdges()` — gated top-k neighbors per node. **Reciprocal (mutual) kNN is the default**
  (an RM-00 experiment): requiring the association to be mutual pruned a one-sided "hub" false
  positive (the noise-schedule 'Thursday' collision) with no regressions — a Pareto win.
- `neighborhood()` — one-hop expansion from the returned cosine seeds into the `Related:` block.
- `reachableConstraints()` — **constraint rescue.** Typed "apex rules" ("I'm diabetic", "afraid
  of heights") sit at the *bottom* of cosine for the queries they should gate, because a rule
  rarely restates its trigger. The recall path decouples the internal **search radius**
  (top-`K_SEARCH`=15) from the **return radius** (top-5): a constraint that ranks into the wider
  pool via a genuinely query-relevant bridge is rescued into `Related:`, even though the model
  never sees it directly. Restricted to *typed constraints* so the wider radius can't re-drag
  ordinary hubs back in — TBR (tangent bleed) is protected by construction, not by luck.

### `edges.js` — the unified edge table (Phase 0; was `ledger.js`)

"Fire together, wire together." One persistent sidecar (`<store>.edges.json`) holding both
signals. Phase 0.1 persists save-time semantic neighbors here (K=5, min cosine 0.25,
Hebbian weight 0); **recall still rebuilds semantic kNN in `field.js`** (minSim 0.55) and
does not read the cached semantic signal yet. The two cosine thresholds are deliberate
(Risk #2): recall's 0.55 is what the model *sees*, save's 0.25 is what is *worth writing*.
The learned Hebbian weight lives on the edge record and is the source of truth. Safety
properties, preserved byte-for-byte from the retired `Ledger`:

- **Canonical undirected edge key** (ids sorted) so `a:b` and `b:a` are one edge.
- **Bounded bonus** via `maxBonus·tanh(w)` — frequency can lift a weak edge over the `minSim`
  gate but can never swamp the semantic floor.
- **Provenance-discounted reinforcement** — primary↔primary at full `alpha`, primary↔neighborhood
  discounted, neighborhood↔neighborhood zero. The graph learns from the user's queries, not from
  its own guesses. This provenance instinct is what `RM-16` generalizes to the whole write path
  **and** to the writer of the learned signal (Phase 0.6 sketch:
  [`proposed/0009`](proposed/0009-edge-threat-model.md) — semantic recomputes, a poisoned
  reinforcement is a durable false memory; `RM-16` stays gated to Phase 2 / the 2.2 gate).
- **Decay** is lazy wall-clock via `effectiveHebbian` (`w · 2^(−Δt/H)` from
  `hebbian.last_updated`; H is a per-type half-life in seconds). Computed on read, not
  stored. Unused associations fade with elapsed time, not recall count (I6).
- **Materialize on mutation (Phase 0.3).** A reinforcing write first stores
  `effectiveHebbian(edge, now)` as `hebbian.weight`, then adds α, then stamps
  `hebbian.last_updated = now`. Provenance is preserved; a pruned edge is
  revived in place first (0.4). After the write, stored weight and effective weight coincide, so
  reinforcement can never bypass accumulated decay (the "ghost weight" of
  adding α to an undecayed stored value after a long idle). At Δt≈0 this is
  a no-op on the number — an instant eval does not move.
- **Request-ID idempotency (Phase 0.3).** One MCP JSON-RPC request id = one
  mutation transaction, applied to every edge-mutating op (`reinforceRecall`,
  save-time bind). The processed-id LRU (`DEDUP_LRU_SIZE = 256`) lives in the
  sidecar as `processed_ids` so the id and the weight change are one
  `writeFileDurable`. No id → apply, don't record (eval / non-JSON-RPC).
  This is **orthogonal to `W-04`**: it dedups same-process retries, it does
  not serialize concurrent panel + MCP writers.

Neither layer ever reorders the primary cosine result — invariant #3 / I9. A corrupt sidecar
fails open to empty (bonus 0); recall still returns cosine (I3).

- **Soft prune (Phase 0.4 / I8).** An explicit `pruneSweep()` (MCP startup or on
  demand — never `recall`/`save`) marks an edge `pruned_at` only when it is
  **both** unreinforced (`effectiveHebbian < 1e-6`) **and** semantically weak
  (`semantic.value < 0.25`, the save-time bind floor). An idle but
  semantically-strong edge stays, so constraint-rescue does not regress
  (RESULTS field experiment #2 — the two-signal rule). The record is kept;
  `incident()` skips it. `EdgeStore.vacuum()` is the hard drop, also
  explicit. Reactivation is a consequence of `save`/`edit`/`reinforce`
  touching an endpoint: `pruned_at → null`, `created_at` and the decayed
  Hebbian bytes preserved, `prune_count` / `first_pruned_at` /
  `last_reactivated_at` kept as O(1) history. No fifth tool (I1).

## 8. The temporal model (bi-temporal, after Graphiti)

Defined once in `record.js`. Every field is backfilled by `normalize()` on read, so this
doubles as the migration path — an old record simply gains new fields on first load, with no
migration step.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `valid_from` | when this became true in the world |
| `valid_to` | when it stopped being true; `null` = still true now |
| `last_confirmed` | last time we saw evidence it still holds |
| `superseded_by` / `supersedes` | forward/back pointers along the supersession chain |
| `revision` | position in the chain (1 = original) |
| `needs_review` | an ambiguous conflict both kept for a human to look at |
| `source` | provenance (`user_stated` default) — the `RM-16` groundwork |
| `is_constraint` | server-assigned constraint type (lexical, from text) |
| `embedding_version` | generation of the stored vector (Phase 0). Starts at `1`; increments only when `edit()` writes a real new vector. A failed embed omits it from the patch (`BUG-008` class). Cached semantic edges later compare this against `src_versions`. |

A superseded memory is **never deleted**: `valid_to` is set to the successor's `valid_from`,
producing a non-overlapping validity chain you can walk backwards. `store.current()` excludes
superseded rows (what recall answers from); `store.active()` keeps them (history). This is the
single most-copyable good idea in the market, and — as the code proves — it needs no graph
database.

---

## 9. The evaluation harness (RM-00) — the measurement system

`eval/` is not a test folder; it is the instrument the whole roadmap depends on. Its reason to
exist: extraction, dedup, and conflict handling are all features that can make the system
*worse*, and without a regression gate you cannot tell. It is **offline and deterministic** —
it reads `eval/embeddings.cache.json` and never touches the network or an API key.

- `eval/pipeline.js` wires the *same* `memory-core.js` the server runs to a cached embedder, so
  the golden is a regression guard on the server itself, not on a copy.
- `eval/run.js` runs the fixture corpora (`basic`, `contradictions`, `constraints`,
  `adversarial`, `field-noise`, `field-stress`) with the field **off and on**, reports the
  **ROC** (did the apex constraint surface?) and **TBR** (did forbidden junk bleed in?) split,
  and gates against `golden.json`. `--filter <id>` runs a subset; `--accept` locks the current
  scorecard as the new golden. Measurement corpora (`duplicates`) are skipped here.
- `eval/measure.js` runs reporting metrics from the registry in `eval/metrics.js`
  (`recall_at_k`, `duplicate_rate`, `extraction_precision`, `extraction_recall`, `mrr`;
  add more with `register(...)`). A/B numbers, not the
  golden gate. See `eval/RESULTS.md` (RM-02.a baseline, RM-02.b A/B and RM-02.c
  backfill: dup_rate 0.3182 → 0.0000, recall@5 held at 1.0000).
- Current scorecard: **27/31 checks**, field lifts 3 cases fail→pass and the golden gate holds.

`npm test` (57 tests) covers the substrate directly; `npm run eval` covers recall behavior.
Both run in well under a minute. The acceptance test for the harness itself: a deliberately
broken change (e.g. rank by recency) is caught by the gate.

---

## 10. The build pipeline

`build-exe.js` produces the single shippable file:

```
[0] embed runtime assets  → generate embedded-assets.js (demo seed + system prompt as strings)
[1] esbuild               → bundle entry.js + all requires into one file, strip per-file
                            AGPL headers, prepend a single collapsed notice
[2] Node SEA blob         → --experimental-sea-config sea-config.json
[3] copy the node runtime → resonance-memory.exe (Windows) / memory (mac/linux)
[4] postject inject       → embed the SEA blob into the copied runtime
    (Windows) flip PE subsystem console(3) → GUI(2) so double-click opens no console window;
    MCP mode is unaffected (LM Studio pipes stdin/stdout)
[5] stage dist/           → the shippable bundle
```

Zero runtime dependencies is load-bearing: it keeps the exe small, the build simple, and the
test suite instant. Build-time tools (`esbuild`, `postject`) are invoked via `npx --yes`, never
installed into `package.json`. SEA is per-platform — the macOS binary must be built on a Mac.

---

## 11. Configuration surface

All environment variables, read at startup:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` | `~/.lmstudio/resonance-memory.jsonl` | the store (sidecars derive from it) |
| `RESONANCE_MEMORY_CONFIG` | beside the store | live field / extract-toggle config file |
| `EMBED_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings` | OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint |
| `EMBED_MODEL` | `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` | embedding model name |
| `RESONANCE_MEMORY_FIELD` | off | default field state when no config file exists |
| `RESONANCE_FIELD_MUTUAL` | on | reciprocal-kNN topology (`0` → directional) |
| `RESONANCE_FIELD_KSEARCH` | 15 | internal search radius for constraint rescue |
| `RESONANCE_CONSTRAINT_GATE` | 0.45 | min cosine for a constraint↔seed bridge |
| `RESONANCE_MEMORY_PANEL_PORT` | 9090 | control-panel port (127.0.0.1 only) |
| `RESONANCE_EXTRACT_LLM` | off | default Tier 2 state when no config file exists |
| `RESONANCE_EXTRACT_MODEL` | auto (first non-embed) | preferred chat model id for Tier 2 |
| `RESONANCE_EXTRACT_TIMEOUT_MS` | 8000 | interactive extract bound; degrade to Tier 0/1 |

The embedder is **not bundled** — we depend on the `/v1/embeddings` *interface*, not a specific
model, so any compatible embedding model can be swapped in.

The panel's HTTP surface (`127.0.0.1` only): `GET /`, `GET /api/state` (includes
`extract_llm` / `extract_capable` / `extract_model`), `GET /api/graph`,
`GET /api/clients`, `GET /api/engine`, `GET /api/system-prompt`, `POST /api/toggle`
(`field` and/or `extract_llm`; extract-on is refused if no capable model),
`POST /api/connect|disconnect`, `POST /api/engine/setup`, `POST /api/ping` (heartbeat). This is
not yet a documented stable API (`RM-12`), and has no CSRF/`Origin` check today (watch-item
`W-02`) — worth settling before it becomes a public surface.

---

## 12. Extension seams (where new work plugs in)

The architecture is built to absorb the roadmap without touching the MCP API or forking the
recall path:

- **Substrate unification** → the two association layers (`field.js` static kNN rebuilt per
  recall, `ledger.js` Hebbian sidecar) merged into one **persistent edge store with two
  independent signals** — semantic (derived / recomputable from vectors) and learned
  (source-of-truth / irreplaceable). The record + sidecar live in `edges.js` and are on
  the live recall path (Slice C). Save-time semantic neighbors persist in 0.1; recall
  still computes semantic kNN in `field.js` until a later gated switchover. I6 is held
  as of 0.2 (lazy wall-clock decay; `tick()` gone from recall). It is a **migration, not
  greenfield** — existing `.assoc.json` sidecars
  are carried into `.edges.json` one-way (`RM-21`, design in
  [`phases/phase-0`](phases/phase-0-edge-substrate.md)).
- **New store backend** → implement the `JsonlStore` method surface (`RM-07`, SQLite).
- **Write-path cleanup** (extraction, dedup) → in `save()` inside `memory-core.js`, before the
  store append (`RM-01`, `RM-02`). A save must never fail because a cleanup tier did.
- **Hybrid retrieval** → a second ranking arm fused with RRF, behind a flag, promoted only on a
  measured A/B win, with `DEVELOPERS.md` amended in the same PR (`RM-05` — this is the one seam
  that touches the cosine-only invariant, and the process guards it).
- **Scoping / multi-agent** → new record fields resolved from client identity, never from a
  model argument (`RM-06`).
- **Idle consolidation** → a background pass on panel idle, strictly off the recall hot path
  (`RM-10`).

The single rule across all of them: capability goes in the substrate, the four verbs stay
fixed, and no unmeasured signal touches ranking.
