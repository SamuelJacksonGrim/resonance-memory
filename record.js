/*
 * record.js - the shared memory-record schema, durable writes, and the access
 * sidecar. Owned here (not in server.js) so the MCP server and the control panel
 * agree on exactly what a record is, byte for byte.
 *
 * Three things live here:
 *
 *   1. normalize()   - the ONE definition of a memory record. Every field is
 *                      backfilled on read, so a store written by any older build
 *                      loads into the current shape with no migration step.
 *
 *   2. writeFileDurable() - write-temp -> fsync -> atomic rename. Replacing a file
 *                      with writeFileSync is NOT atomic: a crash or power loss
 *                      partway through truncates the user's entire memory. Rename
 *                      within a directory is atomic on POSIX and on Windows
 *                      (MoveFileEx), so a reader sees either the whole old file or
 *                      the whole new one - never a half-written one.
 *
 *   3. AccessLog     - retention metadata (access_count / last_access) kept OUT of
 *                      the main store. Recall used to rewrite the entire store file
 *                      just to bump a counter on ~5 rows; since these counters are
 *                      RETENTION signals that never touch ranking (see the ranking
 *                      invariant), they do not belong on the read path at all.
 *                      Same sidecar pattern as ledger.js.
 *
 * Decision helpers also live here so they stay pure and testable: constraint
 * typing, historical-query detection, RM-03 cue-gated detectSupersession,
 * RM-02.b cosine-banded detectNearDuplicate / pickMergeSurvivor, and RM-01.b
 * write-side extraction (normalizeText / splitFacts / guardSecrets /
 * prepareWrite). Callers own persistence. `normalize()` is the record schema
 * — do not overload it for incoming text; that job is `normalizeText`.
 *
 * Temporal fields (RM-04) are defined here too - see docs/proposed/0002.

/*
 * The canonical shape of a memory. Anything absent is backfilled, so this doubles

 *   valid_from     when this became true IN THE WORLD
 *   valid_to       when it stopped being true; null = still true right now
 *   last_confirmed last time we saw evidence it still holds
 *   superseded_by  id of the memory that replaced this one
 *   supersedes     back-pointer to the memory this one replaced
 *   revision       position in the supersession chain (1 = original)
 *   needs_review   an ambiguous conflict: BOTH were kept, a human should look
 *
 *   embedding_version  generation of the stored vector (Phase 0). Starts at 1;
 *                      increments only when a successful re-embed writes a new
 *                      vector. Cached semantic edges later compare this against
 *                      src_versions — a failed embed must NEVER bump it, or a

 *                      (BUG-008 class; see docs/phases/phase-0-edge-substrate.md).
