 * ledger.js - the Hebbian sidecar for the associative field (Phase 2b).
 *
 * Learned memory<->memory association weights, kept ENTIRELY separate from the
 * vector store. The cosine graph (field.js) is the static semantic floor; this
 * ledger is the dynamic layer that reshapes with use ("fire together, wire
 * together") and fades without it (decay + prune).
 *
 * Safety properties baked in here, per the Claude/Gemini design review:
 *   - Canonical undirected edge key (ids sorted) so a:b and b:a are one edge.
 *   - Bounded bonus via tanh: frequency can lift a weak edge over the gate but
 *     can never swamp the semantic floor (bonus in [0, maxBonus)).
 *   - Provenance-discounted reinforcement: primary<->primary full alpha,
 *     primary<->neighborhood discounted, neighborhood<->neighborhood zero -
 *     so the graph learns from the user's queries, not from its own guesses.
