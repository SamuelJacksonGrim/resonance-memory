 * field.js - the associative layer for resonance-memory (Phase 2a, Node prototype).
 *
 * Builds a semantic association graph over stored memories from the vectors we
 * ALREADY store at save time - no new embedding calls, no LLM extraction. Edges
 * are per-node k-nearest-neighbors by cosine of full memory text vs full memory
 * text. That is the RICH-TO-RICH regime the measured finding says works; kNN is
 * relative per node, so it dodges the absolute-similarity floor (~0.45) that made
 * a global threshold connect everything.
 *
 * Recall can then expand from cosine seeds to a neighborhood (a region, not a
 * record). Co-activation reinforcement (memories recalled together strengthen
 * their edge) is a separate, additive weight - it never touches query ranking,
 * which stays pure cosine per the ROADMAP invariant.

 *   opts.bonus: (idA, idB) => number, a bounded Hebbian bonus added to cosine
 *               before gating/ranking (default: none). Lets a learned association
 *               lift a weak-cosine edge over the gate without erasing semantics.
 *   opts.mutual: keep an edge a->b only if a is ALSO in b's top-k (reciprocal kNN).
 *               Default false = the original directional kNN. Directional edges are
 *               asymmetric: a generic "hub" node that shares a token with many others
 *               lands in their top-k and gets dragged into a seed's neighborhood as a
 *               false positive (measured: the noise-schedule 'Thursday' collision).
 *               Mutual kNN requires the association to be reciprocated, pruning those
 *               one-sided hub links. RM-00 judges whether it is a net improvement.
 * Returns Map<id, [{ id, sim }]> sorted by blended score desc.

 * Constraint rescue (RM-00 field experiment #2). Find typed-constraint memories
 * reachable from the (expanded) cosine seed pool within one BIDIRECTIONAL hop, so an
 * apex rule that sits far down cosine ("I'm diabetic", rank 21) still surfaces when a
 * bridge it associates with ("lemon bars", rank 7) made it into the seed pool.
 *
 * Why this is a separate path, not just wider neighborhood(): it only ever returns
 * CONSTRAINTS. The expanded seed radius would otherwise re-drag non-constraint hubs
 * (the mechanic FP) back in; restricting the aggressive reach to typed constraints
 * means a corpus with no constraints (the noise cases) gets nothing new — TBR is
 * protected by construction, not by luck.
 *
 *   records: normalized memories (must carry is_constraint + embedding)
 *   seedIds: the internal cosine seed pool (k_search wide, e.g. 15)
 *   opts.exclude: ids ALREADY returned to the model (skip these — no double-surfacing).
 *              NOTE: this is the RETURNED set (top return_k), NOT the seed pool. A
 *              constraint that ranked into the wider pool but fell outside the returned
 *              top-k is precisely a rescue target (vegetarian, rank 10 with return_k=5).
 *   opts.gate: min cosine for a constraint<->seed association (0.55 default; 0.45 in
 *              stage 2 to reach sub-gate isolates like heights<->rooftop = 0.472)
 *   opts.k:    neighbors examined per constraint (default 2, matches buildEdges)
 *   opts.max:  cap on rescued constraints
 * Returns [{ id, sim, via }] for unreturned constraints, best first.
